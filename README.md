# X-chromosome upregulation operates on a gene-by-gene basis at RNA and protein levels
ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to the GitHub repository for our manuscript entitled "X-chromosome upregulation operates on a gene-by-gene basis at RNA and protein levels" submitted to Nature Genetics.

## Data availability
All raw and processed high-throughput sequencing data (scRNA-seq, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq) generated in this study have been submitted to the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE282792. Moreover, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq datasets from GSE119602 and GSE116480 were reanalyzed.
The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD057399.

## Code availability
The [Notebooks](https://github.com/pasquelab/Mice-XCU/tree/main/Notebooks) directory contains Jupyter Notebooks used for processing the scRNA-seq data and generating figures.
